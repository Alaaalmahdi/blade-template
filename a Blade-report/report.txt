Blade is the in-built templating engine for Laravel framework. Blade is a very powerful and easy to use templating engine that makes writing syntax very easy and readable. 
It comes with its own control structure such as conditional statements and loops. It is very easy to create a Blade template, simply create your view file and save it with the .blade.php extension instead of .php, blade templates are typically stored in the resources/views directory. The main advantage of using blade template engine is that it allows us to create a master template which can be extended by other individual pages.
